Welcome to DMD 100.

My name is Michael Collins, and I'm an Associate Teaching Professor for the Penn State Digital Multimedia Design program. I was a founding faculty member for the program and I wrote DMD 100 back in 2017. Most of the design concepts presented in this course are applicable across media and time, and the course's GitBook will always be accessible online if you want to revisit any of the content throughout your time in the DMD program. The course has gone through some iteration with contributions from faculty members and some insightful recommendations from students, and so I expect updates will continue long into the future.

My professional and academic background is in illustration, interactive media, graphic design, photography and video production, 3D animation, UI/UX for web, product design, digital fabrication, and New Media exhibition art. My professional network extends into pretty much every creative field touching creative digital production, so if I don't know the answer to a question, I can point you to someone who does. I'm also a long time volunteer for ACM SIGGRAPH, which hosts the SIGRGRAPH conference â€” the largest computing graphics conference in the world. Please ask me more about SIGGRAPH Student Volunteering if you are looking to break into the CGI field. 

Please take advantage of my office hours, feedback, and the resources I provide throughout the semester.

I look forward to working with you this semester,
