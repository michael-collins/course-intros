## Welcome to DMD 100!

My name is Michael Collins, and I'm an Associate Teaching Professor for the Penn State Digital Multimedia Design program. I was a founding faculty member for the program and I wrote DMD 100 back in 2017. Most of the design concepts presented in this course are applicable across media and time, and the course's GitBook will always be accessible online if you want to revisit any of the content throughout your time in the DMD program. The course has gone through some iteration with contributions from faculty members and some insightful recommendations from students, and so I expect updates will continue long into the future.

I'm currently really intersted in opensource and open education projects, but my creative background is in illustration, interactive media, graphic design, photography and video production, 3D animation, UI/UX for web, product design, digital fabrication, and New Media exhibition art. I typically teach the capstone course in the degree program, so please let me know if you have any questions about this. My professional network extends into pretty much every creative field touching creative digital production, so if I don't know the answer to a question, I can point you to someone who does. I'm also a long time volunteer for ACM SIGGRAPH, which hosts the SIGRGRAPH conference â€” the largest computing graphics conference in the world. Please ask me more about SIGGRAPH Student Volunteering if you are looking to break into the CGI field. 

We have an active Discord server hosted by the DMD Club. Please consider joining the club, it's a great way to meet your fellow DMD students and ask questions about the courses, the program, and involvement or career opportunties. Reach out to the officers on the Discord for more information. Pleae use the Discord link below this message.
